## Hello, World

👋 Hi, I’m @frankpfan, a Chinese student.

👀 I’m interested in maths and programming.

🌱 During my secondary school life, I became really interested in 
those from what is like LA and calculus to the very simple areas of
category theory and type theory.  I got to know the latter two in Grade 8
when searching for tutors for lexing and parsing with curiosity,
after reading Python docs.

📖 Now that I've stepped into senior high school,
I found most geometric and algebraic theories beautiful...\
... though I don't know very much about all of them.

However, I've got my own understanding about the maths world.

⚡ 'Fun' fact: A lot of **'Chinglish'** words and expressions appear in my code...

## My Programming Experience

I currently like to code with Python or C/C++.

I've used a few IDE's and editors like Python IDLE (if you think it *could be* an IDE),
Visual Studio, PyCharm, Neovim and... sorry, sometimes, when I'm soooo lazy,
Windows Notepad, which has caused much problem. (\*sigh.\*)

I attended a competition on IT when I was a 8th-grader and wrote a
Python GUI programme --- an N-puzzle game, in China called “数字华容道”.
Though as sth for a low-level competition it is a success,
but it was not good as a project before I refactored it later,
with a terribly high coupling degree. 😆

Then I wrote [pinandpi](https://github.com/frankpfan/pinandpi),
which consists of an algorithm that simulates Buffun's needle experiment,
and an application for interaction, history storing and analysing.
However, as my original plan wasn't complete, the app is not quite good.

I've made some small tools for my work, and they've been helpful.

Now I'm still learning and trying to make a better project.
