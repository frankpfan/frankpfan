## Hello, GitHub; Hello, World

👋 Hi, I’m @frankpfan, a Chinese student.

👀 I’m interested in maths and programming.

🌱 I’m currently learning at a secondary school, but I am really
interested in linear algebra, calculus, category theory and type theory...\
... though I don't know very much about all the them.
However, I've got my own ideas about the maths world.

⚡ Fun fact: A lot of **'Chinglish'** words and expressions appear in my code...

## My Programming Experience

I currently like to write with Python, but it's not the end.

I've used a few IDE's and editors like Python IDLE, Visual Studio, PyCharm,
Neovim and... sorry, sometimes, when I'm soooo lazy, Windows Notepad,
which has caused much problem. (\*sigh.\*)

I attended a competition on IT and wrote a Python GUI programme.
It's a N-puzzle game, in China called “数字华容道”.

Then I wrote pinandpi, but it's not quite good.

I've made some small tools for my work, they've been helpful.

Now I'm still learning to make a better project.
