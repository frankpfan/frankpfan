## Hello, Github. Hello, world.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @frankpfan, a Chinese student.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in maths and programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning at a secondary school, but I am really
  interested in linear algebra, calculus, category theory and type theory...
  ... though I don't know very much about all the them.
  However, I've got my own about the maths world.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: frankpfan@outlook.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: A lot of 'Chinglish' words and expressions appear here in my code...
